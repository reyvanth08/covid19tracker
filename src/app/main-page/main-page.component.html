        <h4><strong>What is COVID-19?</strong></h4><hr>
        <p><strong>Coronavirus disease</strong> (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.</p>
        <p>The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>

            <p>It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>

            <p>Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness: about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. 
            </p><p>It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.</p>
            <p>First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel, movement and gatherings.</p>
